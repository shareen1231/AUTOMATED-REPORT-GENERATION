#DESCRIPTION

This Python script automates the analysis and visualization of sales data from an Amazon dataset and generates a professional PDF report. It begins by loading sales data from a CSV file using pandas, making it easy to manipulate and analyze. The script extracts key insights, including a statistical summary of numerical columns and the top five best-selling products based on total revenue. To enhance readability, product names are wrapped if they are too long. Using matplotlib and seaborn, the script visualizes the top-selling products with a bar chart, ensuring clear data representation. The visualization is saved as an image to be included in the final report. The script then generates a well-structured PDF using fpdf, which includes a sales summary table, a list of the top-selling products with their revenue, and the generated sales chart. The PDF is formatted for readability, with aligned text and properly spaced elements, making it suitable for business reporting. Finally, the script saves the report as "Sales_Report1.pdf" and confirms successful generation with a console message.
